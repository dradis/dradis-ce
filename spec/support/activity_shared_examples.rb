# For the 'create' action, pass the ActiveRecord class, e.g. Note, as the second
# argument, e.g.:
#
#     include_examples "creates an Activity", :create, Note
#
# For the 'update' and 'destroy' actions, define a let variable called 'model'
# which returns the model that gets updated/destroyed, e.g.:
#
#     let(:model) { @note }
#     include_examples "creates an Activity", :update
#
# (We can't pass @note in directly, as it doesn't exist in the scope where
# include_examples is called.)
#
# For all actions, you also need to have defined a let variable defined called
# 'submit_form' which performs the action that creates/updates/destroys
# the model in question, e.g.:
#
#     let(:submit_form) { click_button "Save" }
#
