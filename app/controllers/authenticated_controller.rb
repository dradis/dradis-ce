# This controller can be a handy one to inherit from if we are building
# functionality that requires the user to be authenticated.
#
# It isolates the code from the authentication implementation as we will be able
# to change the details of the filter without the inheriting classes noticing.

# Any third-party code (e.g. plugins) should inherit from this class instead of
# calling the authentication filters directly

  # a csrf token. But it is not a csrf attack, it's just that wo/ session the token
  # cannot be checked.
