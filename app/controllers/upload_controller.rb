# The UploadController provides access to the different upload plugins that
# have been deployed in the dradis server.
#
# Each upload plugin will include itself in the Plugins::Upload module and this
# controller will include it so all the functionality provided by the different
# plugins is exposed.
#
# A convenience list method is provided that will return all the currently
# loaded plugins of this category.
