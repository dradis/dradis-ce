Dradis is an open-source collaboration framework, tailored to InfoSec teams.

To try Dradis Community, you can deploy your own instance (you will need accounts in the cloud providers to get started).

## Our goals

* Share the information effectively.
* Easy to use, easy to be adopted. Otherwise it would present little benefit over other systems.
* Flexible: with a powerful and simple extensions interface.
* Small and portable. You should be able to use it while on site (no outside connectivity). It should be OS independent (no two testers use the same OS).


## Some of the features:

* Platform independent
* Markup support for the notes: text styles, code blocks, images, links, etc.
* Integration with existing systems and tools:
  * [Brakeman](https://dradis.com/integrations/brakeman.html)

## Contributing

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

Many thanks to all Dradis Framework [contributors](https://github.com/dradis/dradis-ce/graphs/contributors). Dradis has been around since 2007, and in 2016 we had to do some nasty Git gymnastics resulting in a lot of the previous SVN + Git history no longer being available in the current repo. We haven't deleted it though, and we're still very much grateful for the work of our former [contributors](https://github.com/dradis/dradis-legacy/graphs/contributors).


### Branching model
We're following Vincent Driessen's [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to try to keep things organized.

In this repo we will have: *master*, *develop*, *release-* and *hotfix-* branches.

If you need to work on a feature branch, fork the repo and work on your own copy. We can check it from there. Eventually you'll merge to your *develop* and back to origin's *develop*.


### Community Projects

* [check-user-pwned-dradis by GoVanguard](https://github.com/GoVanguard/check-user-pwned-dradis): Searches for compromised emails across data breaches and creates Dradis Issues
* [csv-data-import-dradis by GoVanguard](https://github.com/GoVanguard/csv-data-import-dradis): Imports Issues, Nodes, Evidence, and Notes from a CSV file into Dradis
