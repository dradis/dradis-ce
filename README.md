Dradis is an open-source collaboration framework, tailored to InfoSec teams.


## Our goals

* Share the information effectively.
* Easy to use, easy to be adopted. Otherwise it would present little benefit over other systems.
* Flexible: with a powerful and simple extensions interface.
* Small and portable. You should be able to use it while on site (no outside connectivity). It should be OS independent (no two testers use the same OS).


## Some of the features:

* Platform independent
* Markup support for the notes: text styles, code blocks, images, links, etc.
* Integration with existing systems and tools:

## Editions

There are two editions of Dradis Framework:

* **Dradis Framework Community Edition (CE)**: open-source and available freely under the GPLv2 license.
* **Dradis Framework Professional Edition (Pro)**: includes extra features that are more useful for organizations dealing with bigger teams and multiple projects at a time. To use Pro and get official support please [become a subscriber](https://dradisframework.com/pro/).


## Getting started: Community Edition

### Git release (recommended)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dradis/dradis-ce.git
$ cd dradis-ce/
$ ruby bin/setup
$ bundle exec rails server
```

You can browse to the app at http://localhost:3000/

### Using Vagrant

If you'd like to use dradis in Vagrant, you can use the included Vagrantfile.

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dradis/dradis-ce.git

# install/start the vagrant box
vagrant up
# ssh into the box
vagrant ssh

# install ruby in the vagrant box
cd /dradis/dradis-ce
rvm install "$(cat .ruby-version)"


# Then you can proceed with standard setup from within Vagrant
ruby bin/setup
# You'll need to tell the server to bind to 0.0.0.0 for port forwarding:
bundle exec rails server -b 0.0.0.0
```

## Contributing

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

Many thanks to all Dradis Framework [contributors](https://github.com/dradis/dradis-ce/graphs/contributors). Dradis has been around since 2007, and in 2016 we had to do some nasty Git gymnastics resulting in a lot of the previous SVN + Git history no longer being available in the current repo. We haven't deleted it though, and we're still very much grateful for the work of our former [contributors](https://github.com/dradis/dradis-legacy/graphs/contributors).


### Branching model
We're following Vincent Driessen's [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to try to keep things organized.

In this repo we will have: *master*, *develop*, *release-* and *hotfix-* branches.

If you need to work on a feature branch, fork the repo and work on your own copy. We can check it from there. Eventually you'll merge to your *develop* and back to origin's *develop*.


### Community Projects
